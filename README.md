# JavaScript Starter Project

## Running JavaScript on your machine
Node allows us to run JavaScript code directly in a computer process itself instead of inside a browser.

Install Node.js from the AppPortal or https://nodejs.org/en/.

Open a new terminal window (PowerShell etc) after installation and type in `npm`. This should write out options for the command to the screen. If it doesn't, check your installation and/or seek assistance.

## Getting Started
To get started, open a new command line console in your IDE (e.g.: Visual Studio, IntelliJ)
and navigate into the `StarterProjects/JavaScript` folder. Here, type in the ```npm install``` command and press enter. 

This will install the required node modules for the project (e.g.: Jest for testing).

To learn more about node modules have a look at 
[W3 Schools Node.js Modules](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_modules.asp).

## Running the Code
To run the code, type in ```node SampleRunner.js``` in your command line console.

## Testing
The JavaScript starter project uses the Jest library for its tests.

To learn more about Jest, check out [Jest - Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).

## Running the Tests
To run the tests you can either: 
- Press the Run Test button next to the test in your IDE
- Run the command ```npm test``` in your command line console
